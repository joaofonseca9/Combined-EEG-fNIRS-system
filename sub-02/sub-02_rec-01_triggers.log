----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! -----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.

help kbname
--- <strong>kbname</strong> not found. Showing help for <strong>KbName</strong> instead. ---

   kbNameResult = <strong>KbName</strong>(arg)
 
   <strong>KbName</strong> maps between KbCheck-style key codes and key names.
 
   * If arg is a string designating a key label then <strong>KbName</strong> returns the
     keycodes of the indicated key. Some key label may have multiple keys
     assigned on some operating systems and keyboards. Therefore the returned
     keycodes may be a vector of multiple keycodes, not just one unique key code.
 
   * If arg is a keycode, <strong>KbName</strong> returns the label of the designated key.
 
   * If no argument is supplied then <strong>KbName</strong> waits one second and then
     calls KbCheck.  <strong>KbName</strong> then returns a cell array holding the names of
     all keys which were down at the time of the KbCheck call. The
     one-second delay preceeding the call to KbCheck avoids catching the
     <return> keypress used to execute the <strong>KbName</strong> function.
 
   * If arg is 'UnifyKeyNames', <strong>KbName</strong> will switch its internal naming
     scheme from the operating system specific scheme (which was used in
     the old Psychtoolboxes on MacOS-9 and on Windows) to the MacOS-X
     naming scheme, thereby allowing to use one common naming scheme for
     all operating systems, increasing portability of scripts. It is
     recommended to call <strong>KbName</strong>('UnifyKeyNames'); at the beginning of each
     new experiment script.
     CAUTION: This function may contain bugs. Please report them (or fix
     them) if you find some.
 
   * If arg is 'KeyNames', <strong>KbName</strong> will print out a table of all
     keycodes->keynames mappings.
 
   * If arg is 'KeyNamesOSX', <strong>KbName</strong> will print out a table of all
     keycodes->keynames mappings for MacOS-X.
 
   * If arg is 'KeyNamesOS9', <strong>KbName</strong> will print out a table of all
     keycodes->keynames mappings for MacOS-9.
 
   * If arg is 'KeyNamesWindows', <strong>KbName</strong> will print out a table of all
     keycodes->keynames mappings for M$-Windows.
 
   * If arg is 'KeyNamesLinux', <strong>KbName</strong> will print out a table of all
     keycodes->keynames mappings for GNU/Linux, X11.
 
   <strong>KbName</strong> deals with keys, not characters. See KbCheck help for an
   explanation of keys, characters, and keycodes.
 
   Please note that <strong>KbName</strong> always assumes a US keyboard layout. Changing
   the keyboard layout settings in your operating system will have no
   effect. If a keyboard with non-US layout is connected, e.g, a german
   keyboard layout, then certain keys may not match. E.g., on a german
   keyboard, the 'Y' key will be reported as 'Z' key and the 'Z' key will
   be reported as 'Y' key, because these two keys are interchanged on the
   german keyboard wrt. the US keyboard.
 
   There are standard character sets, but there are no standard key
   names.  The convention <strong>KbName</strong> follows is to name keys with  the primary
   key label printed on the key.  For example, the the "]}"  key is named
   "]" because "]" is the primary key label and "}" is the  shifted key
   function.  In the case of  labels such as "5", which appears  on two
   keys, the name "5" designates the "5" key on the numeric keypad  and
   "5%" designates the QWERTY "5" key. Here, "5" specifies the primary
   label of the key and the shifted label, "%" refines the specification,
   distinguishing it from keypad "5".  Keys labeled with symbols not
   represented in character sets are assigned names describing those
   symbols  or the key function, for example the space bar is named
   "space" and the apple  key is named "apple".  Some keyboards have
   identically-labelled keys distinguished
   only by their positions on the keyboard, for example, left and right
   shift  keys.  Windows operating systems more recent than Windows 95 can
   distinguish between such keys.  To name such keys, we precede the key
   label with either  "left_" or "right_", to create the key name.  For
   example, the left shift key  is called "left_shift".
 
   Use <strong>KbName</strong> to make your scripts more readable and portable, using key
   labels instead of keycodes, which are cryptic and vary between different
   computers.
 
   For example,
 
   yesKeys = <strong>KbName</strong>('return');
   [a,b,keyCode] = KbCheck;
   if any(keyCode(yesKeys))
     ...
   end;
 
 
   Linux, OS X, and Windows versions of KbCheck return different keycodes.
   You can mostly  overcome those differences by using <strong>KbName</strong>, but with
   some complications:
 
   While most keynames are shared between operating systems, not all
   are. Some key names are used only on Windows, and other key names are
   used only on OSX or on Linux. For a lists of key names common to all
   platforms and unique to each see the comments in the  body of <strong>KbName</strong>.m.
 
   <strong>KbName</strong> will try to use a mostly shared name mapping if you add the
   command <strong>KbName</strong>('UnifyKeyNames'); at the top of your experiment script.
   At least the names of special keys like cursor keys, function keys and
   such will be shared between the operating systems.
 
   Your computer might be able to distinguish between identically named
   keys. For example, left and right shift keys, or the "enter" key on
   the keyboard and the enter key on the numeric keypad. Which of these
   keys it can distinguish depends on the operating system. For details,
   see comments in the body of <strong>KbName</strong>.m.
 
   Historically, different operating systems used different keycodes
   because they used different types of keyboards: PS/2 for Windows, ADB
   for OS 9, and USB for OS 9, Windows, and OSX. KbCheck on OS X returns
   USB keycodes.

INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 70 times out of a total of 622 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least

 <strong>fullfile</strong> Build full file name from parts.
    F = fullfile(FOLDERNAME1, FOLDERNAME2, ..., FILENAME) builds a full
    file specification F from the folders and file name specified. Input
    arguments FOLDERNAME1, FOLDERNAME2, etc. and FILENAME can be strings,
    character vectors, or cell arrays of character vectors. Non-scalar
    strings and cell arrays of character vectors must all be the same size.
 
    If any input is a string array, F is a string array. Otherwise, if any
    input is a cell array, F is a cell array.  Otherwise, F is a character
    array.
 
    The output of <strong>fullfile</strong> is conceptually equivalent to character vector
    horzcat operation:
 
       F = [FOLDERNAME1 filesep FOLDERNAME2 filesep ... filesep FILENAME]
 
    except that care is taken to handle the cases when the folders begin or
    end with a file separator.
 
    <strong>fullfile</strong> collapses inner repeated file separators unless they appear at 
    the beginning of the full file specification. <strong>fullfile</strong> also collapses 
    relative folders indicated by the dot symbol, unless they appear at 
    the end of the full file specification. Relative folders indicated 
    by the double-dot symbol are not collapsed.
 
    To split a full file name into folder parts, use split(f, filesep).
 
    Examples
      % To build platform dependent paths to files:
         fullfile(matlabroot,'toolbox','matlab','general','Contents.m')
 
      % To build platform dependent paths to a folder:
         fullfile(matlabroot,'toolbox','matlab',filesep)
 
      % To build a collection of platform dependent paths to files:
         fullfile(toolboxdir('matlab'),'iofun',{'filesep.m';'fullfile.m'})

----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! -----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.
