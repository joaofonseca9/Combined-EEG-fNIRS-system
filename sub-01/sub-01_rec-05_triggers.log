WARNING: Couldn't compute a reliable estimate of monitor refresh interval! Trouble with VBL syncing?!?


----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! -----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.

help randi
 <strong>randi</strong> Pseudorandom integers from a uniform discrete distribution.
    R = <strong>randi</strong>(IMAX,N) returns an N-by-N matrix containing pseudorandom
    integer values drawn from the discrete uniform distribution on 1:IMAX.
    <strong>randi</strong>(IMAX,M,N) or <strong>randi</strong>(IMAX,[M,N]) returns an M-by-N matrix.
    <strong>randi</strong>(IMAX,M,N,P,...) or <strong>randi</strong>(IMAX,[M,N,P,...]) returns an
    M-by-N-by-P-by-... array.  <strong>randi</strong>(IMAX) returns a scalar.
    <strong>randi</strong>(IMAX,SIZE(A)) returns an array the same size as A.
 
    R = <strong>randi</strong>([IMIN,IMAX],...) returns an array containing integer
    values drawn from the discrete uniform distribution on IMIN:IMAX.
 
    Note: The size inputs M, N, P, ... should be nonnegative integers.
    Negative integers are treated as 0.
 
    R = <strong>randi</strong>(..., CLASSNAME) returns an array of integer values of class
    CLASSNAME.
 
    R = <strong>randi</strong>(..., 'like', Y) returns an array of integer values of the
    same class as Y.
 
    The arrays returned by <strong>randi</strong> may contain repeated integer values.  This
    is sometimes referred to as sampling with replacement.  To get unique
    integer values, sometimes referred to as sampling without replacement,
    use RANDPERM.
 
    The sequence of numbers produced by <strong>randi</strong> is determined by the settings of
    the uniform random number generator that underlies RAND, RANDN, and <strong>randi</strong>.
    <strong>randi</strong> uses one uniform random value to create each integer random value.
    Control that shared random number generator using RNG.
 
    Examples:
 
       Example 1: Generate integer values from the uniform distribution on
       the set 1:10.
          r = randi(10,100,1);
 
       Example 2: Generate an integer array of integer values drawn uniformly
       from 1:10.
          r = randi(10,100,1,'uint32');
 
       Example 3: Generate integer values drawn uniformly from -10:10.
          r = randi([-10 10],100,1);
 
       Example 4: Reset the random number generator used by RAND, <strong>randi</strong>, and
       RANDN to its default startup settings, so that <strong>randi</strong> produces the same
       random numbers as if you restarted MATLAB.
          rng('default');
          randi(10,1,5)
 
       Example 5: Save the settings for the random number generator used by
       RAND, <strong>randi</strong>, and RANDN, generate 5 values from <strong>randi</strong>, restore the
       settings, and repeat those values.
          s = rng
          i1 = randi(10,1,5)
          rng(s);
          i2 = randi(10,1,5) % i2 contains exactly the same values as i1
 
       Example 6: Reinitialize the random number generator used by RAND,
       <strong>randi</strong>, and RANDN with a seed based on the current time.  <strong>randi</strong> will
       return different values each time you do this.  NOTE: It is usually
       not necessary to do this more than once per MATLAB session.
          rng('shuffle');
          randi(10,1,5)

PTB-INFO: for it. This will introduce a very small and constant offset (typically << 1 msec). Read 'help BeampositionQueries'
PTB-INFO: for how to correct this, should you really require that last few microseconds of precision.
PTB-INFO: Btw. this can also mean that your systems beamposition queries are slightly broken. It may help timing precision to
